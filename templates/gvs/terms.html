                        <p class="fs-8 mb-2 lh-lg ">By using any of our services, you agree to be bound by the terms, conditions and policies of GVS Group, GBH shipping & Logistics, herein referred to as GVS and GBH:

                          Refund Policy – Customers are eligible for refunds from GVS/GBH Couriers ONLY when we fail to perform duties under our advertised/ contracted services. We are NOT responsible, under any circumstances for providing refunds for issues arising out of the non-performance of a seller or other third party. If a refund is provided from a seller/ third party for their non-performance or non-conformity of goods, GVS/GBH Couriers will NOT be obligated to provide additional compensation for services rendered for purchasing or transporting such goods such as our administrative fee, shipping, customs duty, HAZMAT, etc. Please allow 1-3 business days for refunds to be processed.
                         <br><br> Return Policy – Customers are responsible for ALL return costs for goods required to be returned or exchanged by their seller(s) unless the reason for a return is due to the fault/ negligence relating to a service explicitly offered by GVS/GBH Couriers. Expectations of duties beyond the reasonable capabilities of our systems or that of our sub-contractors will not be considered in an assessment of liability.
                          <br>Insurance – Our insurance policy ONLY covers loss or damage of packages while in our possession and is subject to section (7) and (13) of this page. All Mailbox shipments will be charged a minimum non-waivable insurance charge that covers up to US$50 in value unless additional coverage is purchased BEFORE a shipment is loaded for transit to Guyana. If eligible, all reimbursements will be equivalent to 120% of the invoice value corresponding to the applicable coverage. Shipping and customs duty charges are non-refundable. Insurance coverage only applies to packages in transit from our Miami warehouse to Guyana and does not apply to manufacturer defects and other vendor related issues. GVS/GBH Couriers WILL NOT be liable for incorrect, missing or damaged goods that arrive at our warehouse from ANY seller, shipper or merchant.
                          <br><br>Package Collection – Customers have a maximum of 14 days from the date of arrival in Guyana to collect their orders/ shipments. Failure to do so within the specified time frame will result in a holding fee charge of GYD$2000. If a package is left uncollected for TWO (2) months it shall be SOLD with any prior payments forfeited unless other arrangements are agreed to in writing.
                          <br>Dangerous & Restricted Goods – Some goods are considered too dangerous for standard air transport and may require additional certification to be shipped. Other products may be prohibited either by international aviation regulations or local import laws. Our Dangerous Goods handling process conforms to the regulations outlined by IATA. Please see our Dangerous/ Restricted Goods for a list of common prohibited items as well as those that require additional HAZMAT certification. Depending on the class of goods some hazardous products may attract additional charges beyond those advertised on our site. HAZMAT flights occur once per month.
                          I.D. Policy – A valid government issued ID is required to collect packages at our office.
                          <br>Inspection Policy – All packages must be inspected thoroughly in the presence of a GVS/GBH Couriers rep at the time of collection for an insurance claim to be valid. NO EXCEPTIONS.
                          <br>Termination – GVS/GBH Couriers reserves the right to refuse business or terminate accounts for customers who are found to be in breach of our terms & conditions or for any other reason we perceive as detrimental to our company.
                          <br>Anti-Waiver – GVS/GBH Couriers expressly disclaims to customers that is does not waive its right as it relates to any of the clauses outlined in these terms and conditions by choosing to offer services/ assistance outside or beyond the scope of this document.
                          <br><br>Order Service – GVS/GBH Couriers is not a seller of any goods purchased through our order service, neither are we affiliated in any way with sellers, websites, or merchants that you choose to order from. Customers accept all risks associated with ordering from such third parties.
                          <br>Warranty – GVS/GBH group Couriers, its affiliates and any third-party providers, as well as their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and agents make no warranties, express or implied, and expressly disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular use or purpose.
                         <br><br> Entire Agreement – This written agreement, in its current form, and as duly agreed to (by using our service) by Parties, constitutes the complete, full and exclusive agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and integrates every and all prior terms, covenants and arrangements into this single agreement, representing the final intentions of the parties and explicitly excludes any additional or complementary agreement.
                         <br> <br>Rates – Please visit our rates page for our most updated information about our charges. These rates are subject to change at any time and without prior notice.
                         <br><br> USPS Disclaimer: USPS does NOT deliver to our warehouse. Any tracking status showing otherwise is false and misleading. We will not be liable for packages shipped by USPS unless it is scanned and issued a warehouse receipt by our warehouse. Any packages marked as delivered by USPS but not scanned by our warehouse will not be considered as received and customers will be responsible for contacting their sellers or USPS directly to get assistance with those packages. It’s common for packages marked as delivered by USPS to take an additional 1-3 business days or longer to be collected by our warehouse.
                          <br><br>IMPORTANT: Policy regarding AMAZON.COM orders/ shipments – Amazon.com has recently implemented a non-cooperation/ no-support policy for orders being shipped to freight forwarders. We believe that this policy disproportionately burdens customers using freight forwarders and creates an environment that allows Amazon’s fulfillment employees to exploit this policy for their own personal gain. Our experience with this mainly involves missing or replaced high-value goods in packages exclusively shipped using Amazon’s internal logistics service.
                          <br>We again reiterate that GVS/GBH Couriers WILL NOT be liable for incorrect, missing or damaged goods that arrive at our warehouse from ANY seller, shipper or merchant.
